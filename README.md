Data Analysis Results
The boxplots show that patients with "bad" first assessments had higher blood pressure than those with "good" assessments. This pattern held true for the second assessment and final decision categories as well - patients labeled "high risk" consistently showed elevated blood pressure readings. The data suggests doctors' judgments matched the actual vital signs.


The histograms reveal interesting patterns in the data distribution. Visit frequency was fairly spread out between 0.2 and 0.6, with one patient at 0.9 who visited much more often. Blood pressure showed two clusters - one group around 60-80 and another around 170-180, indicating we had both normal and high blood pressure patients in our sample.


Removing the missing value reduced our dataset from 10 to 9 patients. While this was necessary for the analysis, it represents a 10% loss of data. The results show reasonable alignment between physician assessments and measured blood pressure, though this simulated data has limitations for drawing real clinical conclusions.
